# USB Camera to IP Camera with Barcode Scanning

A complete solution for transforming your USB camera into an IP camera with both web access and a professional desktop client! This system includes a Python server that streams video from any USB camera over your local network, plus a modern GUI client for viewing and managing camera streams.

Real-time barcode scanning powered by **Dynamsoft Barcode Reader**! The GUI client also supports live barcode detection with visual overlays showing detected codes directly on the video stream.
